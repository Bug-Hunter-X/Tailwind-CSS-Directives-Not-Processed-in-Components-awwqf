This error typically occurs when Tailwind CSS directives are used inside a component or template that hasn't been correctly configured to process them. This might happen if you're using a framework like Vue.js, React, or Svelte, and you haven't properly integrated Tailwind with your build process or configured the component to use Tailwind's directives.  For example, in Vue, you might forget to import the Tailwind directives or use the `v-bind` properly.
